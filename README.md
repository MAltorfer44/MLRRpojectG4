Note, in this Readme the file: "XYZ" will be called "the markdown". 

If you want to run the markdown and knit it to a pdf and html document, please follow these instructions:

1) Save all the files on Github in one folder on your machine.
2) Download the data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sooyoungher/smoking-drinking-dataset/data and save it as csv in the same folder. Name it "smoke". Note, it is too large to be saved on Github.
3) Open the project in RStudio by clicking on "MLProject".
4) Open the script RF_V2 and run it. It saves the object "bm.Rdata". This object is required for the markdown but too large to save on Github. The script may run a couple of minutes.
5) Open and run the markdown. It should take less than 10 minutes to knit.

The other Rscripts contain more detailed code and ideas that were not included into the final project. However, you may still run them. Note, the training and tuning of some models may take a while (>1 hour).
